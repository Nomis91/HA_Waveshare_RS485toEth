# Installation Guide - Waveshare RS485-to-ETH Home Assistant Integration

## Prerequisites

Before installing this integration, ensure you have:

- **Home Assistant**: Version 2023.12.0 or newer (install from https://www.home-assistant.io)
- **Waveshare RS485-to-ETH Device**: 
  - Model: RS485 to Ethernet converter
  - Default TCP port: 8234
  - Network connectivity verified
- **Solar Inverter**: Connected to the RS485 gateway
- **Network**: Home Assistant must be able to reach the gateway via network

## Step 1: Verify Network Connectivity

Before installation, test connectivity to your Waveshare device:

### From Linux/macOS:
```bash
# Test TCP connection to gateway
nc -zv <gateway_ip> 8234
# Expected output: Connection successful
```

### From Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
# Test TCP connection to gateway
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <gateway_ip> -Port 8234
# Expected: TcpTestSucceeded should be True
```

## Step 2: Install the Integration

### Option A: Installation via HACS

[HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) (Home Assistant Community Store) is the easiest way to install and manage custom integrations.

#### Prerequisites

- HACS must be installed in your Home Assistant instance
  - If not installed, follow the official guide: https://hacs.xyz/docs/use/download/download/
- Home Assistant 2023.12.0 or newer

#### Steps

1. **Add Custom Repository**:
   - Open Home Assistant
   - Go to **HACS** (in the sidebar)
   - Click the three-dot menu (⋮) in the top-right corner
   - Select **Custom repositories**
   - In the dialog that opens:
     - **Repository**: Enter the GitHub URL:
       ```
       https://github.com/Nomis91/HA_Waveshare_RS485toEth
       ```
     - **Category**: Select **Integration**
   - Click **Add**
   - Wait for HACS to validate the repository

2. **Install the Integration**:
   - Go to **HACS → Integrations**
   - Search for **"Waveshare RS485-to-ETH"**
   - Click on it to open the details page
   - Click **Download** in the bottom-right corner
   - Confirm the download
   - Wait for HACS to download the files

3. **Restart Home Assistant**:
   - Go to **Settings → System → Restart**
   - Click **Restart Home Assistant**
   - Wait for Home Assistant to fully restart

4. **Enable the Integration**:
   - Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Integrations**
   - Click **+ Create Integration**
   - Search for **"Waveshare RS485-to-ETH Gateway"**
   - Follow the configuration wizard (see [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md))

#### Keeping the Integration Updated

Once installed via HACS, updates will be detected automatically:

1. Go to **HACS → Integrations**
2. If an update is available, you will see an **Update** indicator
3. Click on the integration and then **Update**
4. Restart Home Assistant to apply the update

### Option B: Manual Installation

1. Download the integration files to your computer
2. Connect to your Home Assistant system (via SSH or file browser)
3. Navigate to: `custom_components/` folder
4. Create folder: `waveshare_rs485toeth/`
5. Copy all integration files to this folder
6. Directory structure should be:
   ```
   ~/.homeassistant/custom_components/waveshare_rs485toeth/
   ├── __init__.py
   ├── config_flow.py
   ├── const.py
   ├── manifest.json
   ├── strings.json
   ├── core/
   ├── coordinators/
   ├── devices/
   ├── errors/
   ├── health/
   └── platforms/
   ```
7. Restart Home Assistant

## Step 3: Enable the Integration

After installation:

1. Open Home Assistant web interface
2. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Integrations**
3. Click the **+ Create Integration** button
4. Search for "Waveshare RS485-to-ETH Gateway"
5. Click to select the integration
6. Follow the 3-step configuration wizard (see Configuration Guide below)

## Step 4: Verify Installation

Once configured:

1. Check **Settings → Devices & Services** for a new device entry
2. Click the device to see created entities
3. Look for sensors like:
   - `sensor.waveshare_rs485toeth_*_solar_pv1_power`
   - `binary_sensor.waveshare_rs485toeth_*_connection_status`
   - `sensor.waveshare_rs485toeth_*_response_time`
4. Entities should update regularly (default: every 30 seconds)

## Waveshare Device Setup

### Network Configuration

1. **Physical Setup**:
   - Connect RS485 device to solar inverter via RS485 A/B cables
   - Connect Waveshare to network (Ethernet)
   - Ensure proper RS485 line termination (120Ω resistor at each end)

2. **Find Device IP**:
   - Access your router web interface
   - Look for "Waveshare" or unknown DHCP clients
   - Or use network scanning tools:
     ```bash
     nmap -p 8234 192.168.1.0/24
     ```

3. **Set Static IP** (recommended):
   - Access Waveshare web interface (http://<gateway_ip>)
   - Configure static IP to prevent connection issues
   - Note the IP address for Home Assistant configuration

### RS485 Wiring

Proper RS485 termination is critical:

```
     Terminal 1         Terminal 2
     (Waveshare)      (Inverter or far end)
        ┌─────────────────────┐
   A ──┤├─────────────────────┤├── A
        │ RS485 Cable (twisted)│
   B ──┤├─────────────────────┤├── B
        │                     │
   GND─┤├─────────────────────┤├─ GND
        │                     │
        │  120Ω Terminator    │
        │  (if at far end)    │
        └─────────────────────┘
```

**Important**: Install 120Ω termination resistors:
- Between A and B at Waveshare device
- Between A and B at furthest inverter or end of line
- Do NOT add termination in the middle of the line

## Troubleshooting Installation

### Integration Not Appearing
- Verify integration files are in correct location
- Check file permissions (should be readable)
- Restart Home Assistant completely (not just reload)
- Check Home Assistant logs for errors:
  - **Settings → System → Logs**

### Connection Test Fails
- Verify gateway IP address is correct
- Check network connectivity:
  ```bash
  ping <gateway_ip>
  ```
- Verify port 8234 is open:
  ```bash
  telnet <gateway_ip> 8234
  ```
- Check Waveshare device is powered on
- Review Waveshare device logs if available

### Device Discovery Fails
- Ensure at least one inverter is connected and powered on
- Verify RS485 wiring is correct
- Check Modbus slave IDs are in valid range (typically 1-10)
- Try manual device configuration if auto-discovery fails

### Entities Not Creating
- Check integration debug logs
- Verify device type was correctly detected
- Ensure device is in "healthy" state (not offline)
- Try reloading the integration
